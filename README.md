<h3 align="center">A software developer</h3>

I specialize in Backend development, with a strong focus on system design and web application architecture.

I mainly work with the following technologies:
- C#/.NET for backend development
- Angular for web applications
- Flutter for mobile development

I’m open to working with other technologies as well, such as:
Such as:
 - Rust
 - C

I understand that the technology is not the most important part of a project.
